# 🚀 My Personal Blog — Not Just Another Blog™

Welcome to my **digital playground** — a place where  
💭 thoughts  
💻 code  
🧪 experiments  
🎨 chaos  
all collide.

This is **my personal blog website**, built for fun, creativity, and learning — not likes, not trends, just *me on the internet*.

## 🧠 What is this site?
A **read-only personal blog** where I post:
- Tech learnings 🧑‍💻
- Developer thoughts 💡
- Experiments & side quests 🧪
- Random stuff I find cool 😎

No accounts.  
No comments (maybe later 👀).  
Just content.

- Inspired by **Tetsuo-style creative websites**
